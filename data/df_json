It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.","Word count":427},{"Line number":549,"Character":"Klondike","Place":"int. locker room","Time":"night","Line":"It's time, Butch.","Word count":3},{"Line number":550,"Character":"Butch","Place":"int. locker room","Time":"night","Line":"I'm ready.","Word count":2},{"Line number":551,"Character":"Sportscaster #1","Place":"int. locker room","Time":"night","Line":"\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.","Word count":19},{"Line number":552,"Character":"Sportscaster #1","Place":"ext. alley (raining)","Time":"night","Line":"...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring.

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\" I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.","Word count":242},{"Line number":1181,"Character":"Jules","Place":"int. coffee shop","Time":"morning","Line":"It's cold.","Word count":2},{"Line number":1182,"Character":"Vincent","Place":"int. coffee shop","Time":"morning","Line":"I think we oughta leave now.","Word count":6},{"Line number":1183,"Character":"Jules","Place":"int. coffee shop","Time":"morning","Line":"That's probably a good idea.","Word count":5}]
